NOTE:

The Main Instument Panel uploaded is NOT dimensionally accurate to a real A-10C Warthog

It is an edited version of the one provided in Flims plans, released with his permission, to fit my designed panels and mount over a 27inch LCD front panel

To purchase the plans- email Flim at: Flim.vrpits@outlook.com, or read this forum thread: https://forums.eagle.ru/topic/230557-a-10c-cockpit-plans-cad-files-for-cnc/?tab=comments#comment-4477354
