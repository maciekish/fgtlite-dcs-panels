These labels are for a 30mm GAU-8 Round Wall Display

The Rounds are not my design and were made by thingiverse user Hein_ and licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

They can be downloaded and 3D printed from here:

I mounted them by simply drilling two holes and attaching them to a wooden board with some self tapping screws.

The labels can be 3D printed in white filiment, then spray painted black, then lightly sanding the black paint off on the raised text to reveal the white.
