I have no interest in claiming copyright on my own work. All the files included are my own. I am releasing these files to the public, do with them what you will. 
A lot of work went in to this, and im sharing in the hope that others will continue the hobby of home cockpit building. The world needs more virtual Hog drivers. Vipers and Hornets can GTFO (lol jk).

Please note that i will NOT release any intellectual property that is not my own- so the files for the cockpit stucture I used are not here. 
You can purchase them, as i did, from here- https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=269587, or email Flim at- Flim.vrpits@outlook.com
Same goes for some of the knobs around the cockpit- which i purchased on shapeways here- https://www.shapeways.com/shops/a-10c-warthog-supplies



A FEW POINTS	
	
	1) All of these files are my own creations. 
	2) They are NOT exact replicas of an A-10 Thunderbolt II. They are a pretty good representation of the one modelled in DCS.
	3) Each Panel has its own folder, containing a printable PDF (with each panel section and a colour complete version to use as a template) as well as a .dxf file (for laser/cnc cutting).
	4) The external panel dimensions of each panel are mostly accurate, based on DZUS standards, but I've moved some switches/buttons around to make positioning and wiring easier.
	5) Keypads (UFC and CDU) are ovsersized to allow for normal 2.54 mm pitch prototyping PCB to be used with tactile switches so the keypads are easier to DIY.
	6) The Font used is MS33558, which is the same used in the real aircraft. You can find it free on the internet.
	7) Files marked with (NOTE: Work in progress) may not have been prototyped/proven and/or have known minor errors.
	8) There is no IFF Panel included because I never made one- you can pick the real deal up on eBay every now and then.
