# Another Warthog Project

This is a compilation of various resources to build an A-10C II cockpit for home entertainment. It is loosely based on [The Warthog Project](http://thewarthogproject.com) and frame designs by Flim on the ED forums.

This project started out as an idea for 3d-printed panels for the F-GT Lite racing chair, but as time went on it became more and more obvious that its just too small and i would have to make way too many compromises along the way. For this reason i decided to use some of the available resources online to build a proper cockpit, but still trying to keep it as "stowable" as possible by making it modular and not mounted to the floor.
